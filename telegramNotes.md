Started with the intention of using the examples of Hackspaces to help one another to lead by good examples to document, adopt and share.

The UK Hackspace Foundation can now be better supported by people whom have experience running a Hackspace for a number of years and it can now be time to collect this knowledge together to help each other and new Hackspaces.

Intention is to have files supporting these areas to be stored inside a git repository, that way it can be tracked, version controlled and kept up to date with pull requests guiding on 'how to build a Hackspace', supporting a Hackspace and maintaining a Hackspace.

Observations that there needed to be a way for people to allow their voices to be acknowledged and heard, without hindering the progress of project owners.

#Acknowledged, Repeated Barriers to 'Get Stuff Done'
* Difficult requirements analysis of a task because of lack of experience
* Deciding on a lead action while acknowledging suggested actions and opinions
* Encouraging continued development of the task or finding/handing over the task to enthusiastic people to completion

##A Suggested way to handle tasks:
* Lay out solutions
* Assign someone to be the main person, pick a solution, go for it
* Give people an outlet for feedback when it's requested

#Tools to 'Get Stuff Done'
* Planning:
** Trello
** Google Drive
** Telegram
** Discourse
** Hackpad
* Executing:
** Github

#Website interface to help automate some steps
* Production of a front-end website
* Github back-end
* https://github.com/UKHackspaceFoundation/UKHackspaces.github.io was born
* Could allow Hackspaces to tailor content and then store them locally

#Collaborative inter-hackspace activities
* Hackathon to work on Hackspace beneficial projects such as entry systems or member management
* Inter-hackspace phone network
* SpaceNET

#Identified Needed Items to 'Start and Maintain a Hackspace'

##Marketing
* There is a requirement to help drive new members to a Hackspace, this requires some element of marketing understanding
* This could reach a saturation point for smaller hackspaces in remote locations, villages, or suburbs
* Suggested marketing are online tools such as:
** Meetup
** Social Media
** Local Newspapers (some do have websites)


##Hackspace Entry/Access System
* Each Hackspace has enacted its own
* Most are not completely documented so it's difficult to adapt
* It should be possible to document the basis for an entry system with common recommendations such as electronic door locks
* It may be possible to repo a 'starter entry system' for a Hackspace that is beginning though this will require a dedicated team, decision has been made to put together more of a guide than specifics.
* There exists https://www.facebook.com/MakerSpaceManager/ though it is currently vaporware

##Health and Safety

###Conversation on Junior/Minors in the Hackspace
* Children at the age of 12+ often have exposure to equipment in schools after suitable induction and have an adult around
** This can include band saws and pillar drills
* The 'Traffic light System' (see below) helps to guide people of any age on suitability to use equipment rather than stating an age bias
* 
* Do items need supervision for the safety of the child, or the expense of the item? This should partly govern the decision.
* Taking an opinion from a small person can help to understand what guides them best, for example:
** "She says age ratings don't make sense as it's down to skill and experience, instead her feeling is that a scale like a volume button slider with 0 being
"free to use" and 10 being "adult hands­on (helping you) supervision" and other tools along that scale. She also likes the idea of labelling with an eye (adult within eyesight) and a hand (adult within arm's length) to show the level of supervision required. Rhiannon really appreciated being asked her opinion and thought about it carefully before answering. I would recommend involving any young
members you have when writing guidelines etc. as they will be best placed to say what will work for them. And they will have a greater commitment to the outcome by being involved. Kids & teens are often far better at doing this than adults give them credit for.. :) (Apologies if I have just spoken to any grannies about eggs, I've spent a long time working with 11­18yr olds and they still surprise me!)"

###Maintenance

###Physical Space

##Heating
* Reduce the space you have to keep warm
** Curtains
** Partition walls
** Tarpaulin
** Plastic sheeting as a secondary window glaze layer
** Industrial gas/paraffin/electric/infrared heaters
*** Gas heaters typically require certain ventilation criteria
* If you can't insulate, make it stable by reducing heat egress
* Expanding foam to fill any gaps / reduce drafts
* Draft excluders
* Thermal imagers, if available, can help to identify risk areas

###Induction
* Certification to verify 'completed induction'
* Documentation, how to use equipment, memory joggers after induction complete

###Risk Assessments
* Required for purpose of insurance
* Needed to help people realise how to be safe when using equipment
* Members from Hacman suggested they could export wiki contents for their assessments to a git repo

###Signage

* Traffic light system
** Red being 'Must not use when alone in space'
** Amber being 'must be cleared/trained for usage'
** Green bring 'anyone can use without specific training'
* Could be created by a program
** Using CSS or SVG
** Automated via app/database with images/standard text
** Created with json files, one for universal, other for unique, linked with risk assessment

##Equipment Specific

###Free Hardware
* Companies are receptive to being approached by Hackspaces
** Discounts
** Free hardware

###Sewing Machines

###Laser Cutting
* Un/Suitable materials
* Control boards
* Advisory information

###Lathes (Wood / Metal)
* Safety steps and precautions
* Guides
* Un/Suitable materials

###CNC Router
* Guides
* CAM Toolchains
* Un/Suitable materials

##Software Specific
* Open source software every Hackspace should have
** GIMP
** Inkscape

##Engagement Community Activities
* 'Destruct-a-Day' inspired encouraging children and others to get involved and take things apart.
* Seasonal activities, eg. Pumpkin carving

#Discussion and Consultation
* If there's any change in Hackspace tools, utilities or policy it's always good to have an open and transparent discussion
* Even if you don't enact what people say, people appreciate being respected and acknowledged and considered
* This can aid tolerence of transitions, such as mailing lists
