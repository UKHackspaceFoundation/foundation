##Hackspaces
 A hackspace (also known as Hackerspace, Makerspace, or arts and crafts club for the digital world) is a member run and community operated workspace, where people with similar interests can meet, socialize and collaborate.  See [hackerspace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackerspace) on Wikipedia.


## Foundation Definition

* The UK Hackspace Foundation considers an organisation a Hackspace, and thus eligible to join as a [Member Space](structure.md), if it:
    * is member owned/operated,
    * is an unincorporated or incorporated association,
        * If incorporated, then it must be a not-for-profit / non-profit
    * is based in the UK,
    * has a primary object of providing a shared workspace to its members,
    * has a bank account,
    * has ten or more members,
    * has a democratically elected board of at least 2 directors,
    * conducts its business by allowing each member over 16 one vote,
    * fosters a tolerent and inclusive community (see [Code of Conduct](codeOfConduct.md)), 
    * encourages engagement with, and opening to, the public,
    * describes itself, or its activities, as a Hack(er)space (not necessary in the name or title of the group/business),
    * supporting of 'STEAM' (Science, Technology, Engineerings, Arts, Mathematics)
* Conformance to these criteria is judged by the Foundation's board

Examples of organisations that would not meet this criteria include spaces that are:
* solely used as a rentable, accessible workshop with paid access
* mainly a private club, group or clique (with the exception of membership being a gateway to regular access)
