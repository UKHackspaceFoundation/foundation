# Definition of a Hackspace?

In the past, this page gave the UK Hackspace definition of a 'Hackspace' but this proved to be as productive as attempting to nail spaghetti to the wall with an air powered nailer filled with banana moulded to look like staples and just about as messy.

If your organisation wants to call itself a hackspace, that's fine by us. What we do now ask is that if you wish to become a member space of the UK Hackspace Foundation, you should look at our [requirements for membership](requirementsForSpaceMembership.md).

Please note that this page also makes it clear that the list is not the final word, so have a chat with someone to see if your circumstances can be accommodated.
