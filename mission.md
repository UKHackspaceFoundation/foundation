# Mission Statement

The UK Hackspace Foundation exists to support and further the creation, goals and operating of [Hackspaces](define.md) across the United Kingdom. We are a [not-for-profit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonprofit_organization#United_Kingdom) [co-operative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooperative) [organisation](structure.md) that aims to help [Hackspaces](define.md) to communicate, allowing geographically distributed Hackspace, Makerspace and associated groups to share knowledge, resources, and collectively plan for the future.

The Foundation presents a unified front for UK [Hackspaces](define.md) that enables us to communicate and negotiate with organisations for the benefit of our member spaces, while ensuring that approaches from external organisations are directed to the most appropriate [Hackspace](define.md). We represent a single point of contact for the [Hackspaces](define.md) across the UK, and perform outreach on behalf of the [Maker culture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maker_culture), to raise public awareness and interest in their local spaces.

We aim to make setting up a [Hackspace](define.md) simpler, less daunting, and actively work to foster their development in locations that we know are underserved. Member [Hackspaces](define.md) are to have representatives in the UK Hackspace Foundation who can privately seek advice from other [Hackspaces](define.md) across the UK, we can even introduce them to friendly, specialist contacts, such as lawyers and accountants where necessary. The UK Hackspace Foundation carries out research across the UK [Hackspaces](define.md) (and elsewhere) in order to spot patterns and provide advice based on the collective experience of the member [Hackspaces](define.md).

While the UK Hackspace Foundation exists primarily for the benefit of [Hackspaces](define.md) meeting the agreed [definition](define.md), we maintain active links with other relevant and appropriate groups, communities, and companies. We believe that Hackspaces are part of a larger movement and culture, encompassing many other types of organisation, and that these all are equally important to our growing culture.
