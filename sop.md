# Standard Operating Procedures

Collection of "standard" practises to help provide consistent handling of various HSF activities - especially important given the distributed/voluntary nature of the group.


## Handling Enquiries

Enquiries are likely to arrive via email (to the contact@hackspace.org.uk address), to the HSF twitter account or via the HSF forum.  Irrespective of the medium, the responses should be consistent.  

**Promotions, discounts or other PR for 3rd parties:**

Requests typically of the form "We make/sell/distribute cool stuff that your members may be interested in...  please tell them about us" and may include a discount offer of some sort.  
Response process:

1. Decide if junk/spam - if so, either politely decline or ignore the enquiry
2. If not spam - move conversation onto email (if not already)
3. Send reply using standard response (see below) as the basis - tailor to suit
4. Negotiate from there - try to bring to a conclusion that is beneficial to both parties.  Do not set any expectations or commitments the HSF cannot meet.
5. If a discount mechanism (code or hyperlink) is agreed, then see procedure for setting up new member discounts.

*Reply wording for promo request:*

-----

Thankyou for your enquiry, your product/service seems particularly relevant to the HSF and we'd be happy to publicise your offering to our membership on the basis:

* it's non-exclusive
* comes with a unique benefit (e.g. discount, free product or service)
* will be withdrawn if we receive any reports of poor service

For your information, we distribute offers to our membership using two channels:

* via the member-only section of our website
* via a monthly summary of membership offers (sent out via email)

The preferred mechanism is for you to provide a discount code or special hyperlink (either one-time or reusable) that we can distribute.
 
If this approach is of interest, please can you provide a short a summary of the service(s) you offer along with a suitable discount code/hyperlink.

Kind regards
xxx
On behalf of the UK Hackspace Foundation

**If in doubt:**

* Flag the enquiry to a director
* Send a short reply to the requestor letting them know the request has been referred internally
