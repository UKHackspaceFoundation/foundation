#Code of Conduct#

This code of conduct applies to your behaviour on all Hackspace
Foundation communication channels, and and any events that we run:

* We want to be inclusive; do not engage in homophobic, racist, transphobic, ableist, sexist, or otherwise exclusionary behaviour. Do not make exclusionary jokes, even “ironically”.
* Don’t harass people. Physical contact or sexual attention without enthusiastic consent is harassment, or if taken to its extreme, abuse. Wearing revealing clothes or flirting are not necessarily consent. If you’re asked to stop do so, if you’re not sure the person is happy with what you are doing ask.
* Aggression and elitism are unwelcome – knowledge is not a competition.
* We’d rather you ask about gender than assume, and if you get it wrong, apologise. Mistakes happen, however you should always use the person’s preferred pronouns when addressing or discussing them.
* People’s private lives are their own. Do not share details about others that they have not explicitly made public. This includes, but is not limited to, sexuality, gender, medical conditions, housing, relationship or financial status.
* Although alcoholic drinks are allowed, there is no expectation or pressure to drink alcohol or conversely not to drink alcohol. However, those who are obviously intoxicated will be asked to leave.
* Discussion of how to make our association more inclusive is welcome. Claims that this “has gone too far” aren’t.

Breaches of the Code of Conduct are handled as per the [Consequences of Bad Behaviour](badBehaviour.md) document.
If you have any concerns about someone’s behaviour please let us know either in person, or by emailing contact@hackspace.org.uk.
