#Code of Conduct#

The Hackspace Foundation aims to be a welcoming environment for every
member of the community. These rules apply to interactions in all spaces
managed by the Hackspace Foundation.

Examples included in the code of conduct are just that; this is not an
exhaustive list of behaviours that may be considered in breach of the rules.

* Our association is inclusive; do not engage in homophobic, racist, transphobic, ableist, sexist, or otherwise exclusionary behaviour. Do not make exclusionary jokes, even “ironically”.
* Do not harass people. If someone asks you to stop, stop.
* Be respectful. Not all of us will agree all the time, but disagreement is no excuse for poor behavior and poor manners. A community where people feel uncomfortable or threatened is not a productive one.
* Aggression and elitism are unwelcome – knowledge is not a competition.
* We’d rather you ask about gender than assume, and if you get it wrong, apologise. Mistakes happen, however you should always use the person’s preferred pronouns when addressing or discussing them.
* People’s private lives are their own. Do not share details about others that they have not explicitly made public. This includes, but is not limited to, sexuality, gender, medical conditions, housing, relationship or financial status.
* Discussion of how to make our association more inclusive is welcome. Claims that this “has gone too far” aren’t.

# Consequences

* In all but the most serious cases, you will receive multiple warnings
  before any other action is taken.
* You may be moderated or removed from communications channels.
* If you are an individual member, the Board may decide to revoke your
  membership under Article 6(d).

# Reporting

If you have any concerns about someone’s behaviour please let us know
either in person, by contacting a moderator, or by emailing the board on
to@do.com.
