#Code of Conduct#

Examples included in the code of conduct are just that, this is not an exhaustive list of behaviours that may be considered in breach of the rules.

* Our association is inclusive; do not engage in homophobic, racist, transphobic, ableist, sexist, or otherwise exclusionary behaviour. Do not make exclusionary jokes, even “ironically”.
* Don’t harass people. Physical contact or sexual attention without enthusiastic consent is harassment, or if taken to its extreme, abuse. Wearing revealing clothes or flirting are not necessarily consent. If you’re asked to stop do so, if you’re not sure the person is happy with what you are doing ask.
* Aggression and elitism are unwelcome – knowledge is not a competition.
* Although alcoholic drinks are allowed, there is no expectation or pressure to drink alcohol or conversely not to drink alcohol. However, those who are obviously intoxicated will be asked to leave.
* We’d rather you ask about gender than assume, and if you get it wrong, apologise. Mistakes happen, however you should always use the person’s preferred pronouns when addressing or discussing them.
* People’s private lives are their own. Do not share details about others that they have not explicitly made public. This includes, but is not limited to, sexuality, gender, medical conditions, housing, relationship or financial status.
* Respect other peoples belongings and space:
    * If possible ask before moving people’s things.
    * Don’t spread your things too far and tidy up as you go along – others may be trying to work in the same area.
    * Don’t mess around with other peoples’ projects and possessions without their permission.
* Discussion of how to make our association more inclusive is welcome. Claims that this “has gone too far” aren’t.

If you have any concerns about someone’s behaviour please let us know either in person, or by emailing to@do.com.
