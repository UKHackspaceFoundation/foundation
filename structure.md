# Organisational Structure of the Foundation

Considerations for the Foundation, and obligations of its members:

## Overview
* The Hackspace Foundation ("Organisation") exists to further its [goals](goals.md)
* The Organisation is directed by a small, elected managing board
* The Organisation's membership is made up of hackspaces and individuals, see Membership
* The Organisation's focus is on high-level co-ordination and support, not the running of individual hackspaces
* The Organisation is currently an [unincorporated member association](https://www.gov.uk/business-legal-structures/unincorporated-association)

## Membership
* There are two classes of membership to the Organisation:
    * Individual members ("Members"), and
    * Member Hackspaces ("Member Spaces")

### Member Spaces
* An organisation may join as a Member Space if it meets the Foundation's [definition of a Hackspace](define.md)
* Applications to join the Organisation as a Member Space will be reviewed and accepted at the discretion of the board
* Member Spaces must pay a minimum yearly membership fee of £20, but are encouraged to contribute more.
* If an Member Space's membership fee goes unpaid for two months after being requested, it will cease to be a member.
* In the future, members may be required to pay a contribution towards the Foundation based on:
    * A pro-rate of their membership level (e.g. 0.5% of membership income); or 
    * A percentage of operating surplus
    * Potentiall mandated after the member Hackspace has reached a certain turnover threshold (e.g. £10,000k) or operating surplus
* Member Spaces may each appoint up to 2 people to the Organisation as representatives ("Representatives")
    * These Representatives hold 10 votes between them
    * Representatives do not have to pay an individual membership fee

### Individual Members
* The Organisation has one or more Individual Members who support its objectives.
* Individual Members may apply to join the association and will be accepted at the discretion of the board
* Individual Members cannot also be a Representative of a Member Space
* Individual Members get a single vote in organisational decisions
* Individual Members must pay a yearly membership fee of £10.
* If an Individual Member's membership fee goes unpaid for two months after being requested, they will cease to be a member.

## Board

* The Foundation maintains an elected board to oversee general operation/administration whom:
    * must be Individual Members,
    * should not also be active directors of a Hackspace,
    * are expected to have past experience of managing a Hackspace, or contributing to it
* The board members shall be (re)elected annually


## Longer Term
Longer term, the Organisation may transition into an alternate legal structure, potentially one of:
* [CLG](https://www.gov.uk/business-legal-structures/limited-company)
* [CIC (form of CLG)](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/office-of-the-regulator-of-community-interest-companies)
