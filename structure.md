# Organisational Structure of the Foundation

Considerations for the Foundation, and obligations of its members:

* Overall structure is a small managing board plus a number of member Hackspaces
* Emphasis on high-level co-ordination and support; keeping it simple/minimal
* Member Hackspaces put forward n representatives, where n is small (e.g. 2), to work/vote on Foundation activities
    * Representatives are expected to be directors or trustees of their space
    * Each member Hackspace gets one vote on foundation decisions
* The Foundation maintains an elected board to oversee general operation/administration whom:
    * Should not also be active directors of a Hackspace
    * Are expected to have past experience of managing a Hackspace, or contributing to it, and
    * May be nominated from outside the current Foundation membership
* In the future, members may be required to pay a contribution towards the Foundation which are:
    * Likely to be pro-rated based on Hackspace membership (e.g. 0.5% of membership income)
    * Mandated after the member Hackspace has reached a certain turnover threshold (e.g. Â£10,000k)

Options for transitioning to a legal structures:
