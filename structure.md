# Organisational Structure of the Foundation

Considerations for the Foundation, and obligations of its members:

## Overview
* The Hackspace Foundation ("Organisation") exists to further its [goals](goals.md) to the [benefit](benefits.md) of its members
* The Organisation's membership is made up of hackspaces (Member Spaces) and individuals (Supporter Members), see [Articles of Association](https://github.com/UKHackspaceFoundation/constitution/blob/master/articles.pdf) and the **Membership** section below
* All members are required to follow the [Code of Conduct](codeOfConduct.md)
* The Organisation is directed by a small, elected managing board
* The Organisation's focus is on high-level co-ordination and support, not the running of individual hackspaces
* The Organisation was incorporated on the 9th January 2017

## Membership
* There are two classes of membership to the Organisation:
    * Member Hackspaces ("Member Spaces")
    * Supporter Members ("Members")

### Member Spaces
* An organisation may join as a Member Space if it meets the Foundation's [definition of a Hackspace](define.md)
* Applications to join the Organisation as a Member Space will be reviewed and accepted at the discretion of the board
* Member Spaces must pay a minimum yearly membership fee of £20, but are encouraged to contribute more.
* If an Member Space's membership fee goes unpaid for two months after being requested, it will cease to be a member.
* In the future, members may be required to pay a contribution towards the Foundation based on:
    * A pro-rate of their membership level (e.g. 0.5% of membership income); or 
    * A percentage of operating surplus
    * Potentiall mandated after the member Hackspace has reached a certain turnover threshold (e.g. £10,000k) or operating surplus
* Member Spaces must each appoint up to 2 people to the Organisation as representatives ("Representatives")
    * These Representatives hold 10 votes between them
    * Representatives do not have to pay an individual membership fee

### Supporter Members
* The Organisation has one or more Supporter Members who support its objectives.
* Supporter Members may apply to join the association and will be accepted at the discretion of the board
* Supporter Members cannot also be a Representative of a Member Space
* Supporter Members get a single vote in organisational decisions
* Supporter Members must pay a yearly membership fee of £10.
* If an Supporter Member's membership fee goes unpaid for two months after being requested, they will cease to be a member.

## Board
* The Foundation maintains an elected board to oversee general operation/administration whom:
    * must be Supporter Members,
    * should not also be active directors of a Hackspace,
    * are expected to have past experience of managing a Hackspace, or contributing to it
* See the [Articles of Association](https://github.com/UKHackspaceFoundation/constitution/blob/master/articles.pdf) for more details
