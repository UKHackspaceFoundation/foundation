# Organisational Structure of the Foundation

Thoughts on the organisational (possibly legal) structure of the foundation and member obligations:

* Overall structure is a small managing board plus a number of member Hackspaces
* Member Hackspaces put forward n representatives, where n is small (e.g. 2), to work/vote on Foundation activities
    * Representatives are expected to be directors or trustees of their space
    * Each member Hackspace gets one vote on foundation decisions
* The Foundation maintains an elected board to oversee general operation/administration
    * Board members should not also be active directors of a Hackspace
    * Board members are expected to have past experience of managing a Hackspace
    * Board members may be nominated from outside the current Foundation membership
* In the future, members may be required to pay a small contribution towards Foundation activities (e.g. support of new/struggling spaces)
    * Contributions likely to be pro-rated based on membership (e.g. 0.5% of membership income)
    * Contributions may only be mandated after the member Hackspace has reached a certain turnover threshold (e.g. Â£10,000k)


Major options for legal structures:

* [Unincorporated member association](https://www.gov.uk/business-legal-structures/unincorporated-association)
* [CLG](https://www.gov.uk/business-legal-structures/limited-company)
* [CIC (form of CLG)](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/office-of-the-regulator-of-community-interest-companies)
