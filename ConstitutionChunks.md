#Membership

##Associated organisations

Normally we consider a hackspace to be X but inclusion in the organisation is at the discretion of the directors and reasons will be given at the time of your application if it is rejected

##Removal of Membership

Membership is at all times subject to review. Should your organisational direction change you may no longer be eligable for your previously agreed membership
