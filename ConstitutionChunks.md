#Membership

##Associated organisations

Normally we consider a hackspace to [be X](define.md) but inclusion in the foundation is at the discretion of the directors and reasons will be given at the time of your application if it is rejected

##Removal of Membership

Membership is at all times subject to review. Should your organisational direction change you may no longer be eligible for your previously agreed membership. Membership will be evaluated annually to allow the foundation to react to changes in member organisations directions and directors.


#Directors

##Eligability

For someone to be eligible, they either need to be voted to be the space rep for the foundation for the year, or they need to be specifically proposed and accepted as an independent who we consider to be really valuable.

Current directors of hackspaces are ineligible to become foundation directors on the basis of potential conflicts of interest and time constraints.
