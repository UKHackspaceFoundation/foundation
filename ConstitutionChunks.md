#Membership

##Associated organisations

Normally we consider a hackspace to [be X](define.md) but inclusion in the organisation is at the discretion of the directors and reasons will be given at the time of your application if it is rejected

##Removal of Membership

Membership is at all times subject to review. Should your organisational direction change you may no longer be eligable for your previously agreed membership


#Directors

##Eligability

For someone to be eligable, they either need to be voted to be the space rep for the foundation for the year, or they need to be specifically proposed and accepted as an independent who we consider to be really valuable.

Current directors of hackspaces are ineligeable to become foundation directors on the basis of potential conflicts of interest and time constraints.
